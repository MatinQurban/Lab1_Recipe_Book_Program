# Lab1_Recipe_Book_Program
Build the Recipe Book program we started designing in class (CS1C Saddleback College).

Functionality to demonstrate:

1. Create a recipe book

2. Add recipes to the book

3. Make sure some recipes have post instructions

4. Print the recipe book

5. Edit the details of a recipe (by finding it) and then print the book again. Confirm the details of the recipe changed.
